# SDR Console — single-image deploy (Railway).
# The stack is a Vite/React frontend + a Python backend that serves BOTH the
# JSON API and the built SPA from one process. The backend is stdlib except for
# requirements.txt (pymongo, for the AI SDR attribution store). The committed data/
# ships as a first-boot seed for the Railway Volume mounted at /app/data (see
# docker-entrypoint.sh).
