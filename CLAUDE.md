# CLAUDE.md — project context for Claude sessions

Read this first. It captures the architecture, deployment topology, and operational
facts that aren't obvious from the code. Companion docs: `README.md` (overview),
`USAGE.md` (CLI runbook), `webui/README.md` (console), `.env.example` (every env var,
documented), `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` (pipeline logic).

## What this is

Autonomous outbound pipeline + web console for EverWorker's SDR AI Worker. It pulls ICP
contacts from HubSpot, generates persona-targeted outreach with Claude sub-agents,
enrolls into Email Bison (email) + HeyReach (LinkedIn), logs all activity back to
HubSpot, and reports on results — including nightly AI SDR **deal attribution**.

## Architecture (verified, don't re-derive)

- **One deployed process.** `webui/server/app.py` (~2,800 lines, Python 3.12) serves BOTH
  the JSON API and the built React SPA via `ThreadingHTTPServer`. Routing is a manual
  `if path == "/api/...":` dispatch in `do_GET` / `do_POST`. Every `/api/*` route is
  auth-gated (Bearer token from `/api/login`) unless listed in `_EXEMPT_GET`/`_EXEMPT_POST`.
- **Backend deps:** stdlib only, EXCEPT `requirements.txt` (`pymongo` for the attribution
  store, `dnspython` for technographic detection). Anything importing either must do it
  lazily (see `mongo_store.py`, `tech_signals.py`) so the server still boots without them.
- **Frontend:** React 18 + Vite 5 + Recharts in `webui/frontend/`. API wrappers live in
  `src/api.js`; shared stat tiles / spinners in `src/components/ui.jsx`.
- **Convention:** heavy/write work shells out via `run_script()` to
  `.claude/skills/*/scripts/*.py` (each script prints progress lines, then a JSON summary
  as the LAST stdout line — callers parse that). Read endpoints are in-process
  `*_payload()` functions that must degrade gracefully, never 500.
- **Pipeline scripts** live in `.claude/skills/sdr-pipeline/scripts/`. `hubspot_client.py`
  is the shared stdlib HubSpot client (retry/backoff, `.env` autoload) — extend it, don't
  write new HTTP code.

## Deployment (Railway)

- Railway project has the **sdr-console service** (Docker build from this repo's
  `Dockerfile`; deploys on push to `main`) and a **MongoDB service**.
- **Railway Volume** mounted at `/app/data` = the LIVE data dir. The committed `data/` is
  only a first-boot seed (`docker-entrypoint.sh` copies it in when `pipeline.db` is
  absent). **Prod data on the volume is far ahead of the repo snapshot** — never assume
  repo `data/` reflects production.
- **MongoDB** is wired via `MONGO_URL=${{MongoDB.MONGO_URL}}` (reference variable on the
  sdr-console service, private networking, same project/environment). Database `aisdr`.
- The **Railway CLI is NOT available in cloud Claude sessions** (it's on the user's local
  machine). For Railway dashboard changes (variables, services), either give the user
  click-by-click instructions or ask for a project token. Code changes ship via GitHub →
  merge to `main` → Railway auto-deploys.
- Env vars live in Railway service variables in prod, `.env` locally. `.env.example`
  documents all of them.

## Data stores

| Store | Where | What |
|---|---|---|
| SQLite `data/outreach/pipeline.db` | volume | contacts, batches, signals cache (`account_signals`, incl. the technographic `tech_*` and hiring `hiring_signals/hiring_detail/hiring_checked_at/hiring_error` columns), `hubspot_activity_log` (engagement-logging ledger), `bison_lead_map`, `heyreach_events` inbox, `unenrollment_log` (suppression ledger). Schema: `scripts/batch_db.py`. The web server opens it READ-ONLY; writes go through pipeline scripts (and their in-process module calls, e.g. signal refresh / tech + hiring detect). |
| JSONL under `data/` | volume | campaign stats, generated outreach copy, interested-reply threads/analysis. |
| MongoDB db `aisdr` | Railway MongoDB service | AI SDR deal attribution: `emails`, `contacts`, `deals`, `sync_state` (see below). Accessed only through `scripts/mongo_store.py`. |

## AI SDR deal attribution (added 2026-07, PR #18)

Nightly job answering "which HubSpot deals did the AI SDR create, and what are they worth?"

- **Flow:** the pipeline logs every AI SDR email to HubSpot as an `emails` engagement
  with header From = `HUBSPOT_AISDR_FROM_EMAIL` (`ai-sdr@everworker.ai`). The sync
  (`scripts/aisdr_attribution_sync.py`) searches those engagements (subject/body/date in
  the search response), resolves email→contact and contact→deal associations in batches,
  snapshots everything into Mongo, computes attribution, and writes
  `ai_sdr_deal_created=true` back to HubSpot deals + contacts (only where not already
  true; never un-sets).
- **Attribution rule (user-approved):** a deal counts iff it's associated with an
  AI-SDR-emailed contact AND `deal.createdate >= that contact's first AI SDR email`.
  "Total pipeline" = sum of `amount` over ALL flagged deals incl. closed lost.
- **Scheduling:** `_aisdr_sync_loop()` daemon thread in `app.py`, fires at
  `AISDR_SYNC_HOUR` (default 0 = midnight) America/New_York, DST-safe. First run against
  empty Mongo = full seed; after that incremental via `sync_state.watermark_ms`
  (10-min overlap; upserts by engagement id = idempotent). Contact→deal associations and
  deal snapshots are re-swept EVERY run so late-created deals get attributed and
  stages/amounts stay fresh.
- **Endpoints:** `GET /api/analytics/aisdr` (tiles), `GET /api/hubspot/aisdr/status`,
  `POST /api/hubspot/aisdr/sync` (`{full?, dry_run?}`, background thread, 409 if running).
  UI: top of AnalyticsPage — two accent tiles + "Sync attribution" button.
- **CLI:** `python3 .claude/skills/sdr-pipeline/scripts/aisdr_attribution_sync.py
  [--json] [--dry-run] [--full] [--limit N]`.
- **Operational facts (from the 2026-07-09 seed):** 18,971 AI SDR email engagements,
  5,039 contacts emailed, 9 deals / $282,000 attributed. The seed takes ~15 min at this
  volume; incremental runs take seconds. HubSpot's raw `ai_sdr_deal_created=true` deal
  count (47) is HIGHER than the tiles (9) because ~38 deals carried pre-existing manual
  flags — the tiles show the strict computed attribution from Mongo; the sync preserves
  the manual flags.
- **Gotchas:** reading email engagements requires the **`sales-email-read`** scope on the
  HubSpot private app token (preflight surfaces a clear `missing_scope` error to the UI).
  HubSpot CRM search caps at 10,000 results — the sync windows past it by restarting the
  `hs_timestamp GT` filter (do the same in any new search-based code). `amount` is
  portal-currency, assumed single-currency (USD formatting).

## Technographic detection (added 2026-07)

Deterministic scan of which GTM tech an account runs (CRM / ad pixels / martech /
salestech) — no LLM, no third-party API.

- **Engine:** vendored at root `technographics/` (from the `technographic-signals` repo —
  provenance + re-sync in `technographics/VENDORED.md`). DNS fingerprinting (dnspython,
  resolvers 1.1.1.1/8.8.8.8: MX/TXT/NS/A/SOA + CNAME subdomain probes) + static-HTML
  fingerprinting, matched against a Wappalyzer-derived catalogue (7.5k vendors), scoped by
  `TECH_SELECTION_FILE` (default: curated ~65 marketing/sales vendors).
- **Runner:** `.claude/skills/sdr-pipeline/scripts/tech_signals.py` (module + CLI). Fetcher
  is stdlib urllib (NO requests/bs4); **NO Playwright in the Railway image** — `--rendered`
  exists for Claude sessions only (Chromium preinstalled there).
- **When it runs:** (1) inline in `generate_batch.py` on a research cache miss (under the
  per-domain lock, before copy is written) and after a UI signal refresh; (2) Signals view
  per-row "Detect" + bulk "Detect missing" (`POST /api/signals/tech/detect`,
  `POST /api/signals/tech/backfill` + `GET /api/signals/tech/status/<id>`); (3) a
  fire-and-forget tail after a Message-Batches job completes; (4) `build_play.py` scans the
  prospect pre-research and the play TARGET post-research (appended as a
  "6c-verified" block in research.md).
- **Storage:** `account_signals.tech_signals` (formatted line, or the literal
  `"No signals detected"`; NULL = scan itself failed), `tech_detail` (detections JSON),
  `tech_checked_at` (reused for `TECH_REFRESH_DAYS`, default 90), `tech_error`.
- **Consumers:** generation prompts get the line as background context (reference ONE
  relevant tool max, never list the stack; chat/scheduling tools — Qualified, Drift,
  Intercom, Chili Piper, Calendly — are NEVER mentioned) plus **playbook plays** classified
  from `tech_detail` by `tech_signals.playbook_groups()` (`PLAYBOOK_*` sets; also in the
  scan CLI/API JSON as `playbook`): sequencing tools (Outreach/Salesloft/Apollo) → EMAIL 2
  no-disruption angle (own email+LinkedIn infra, 2-5x on top of the run rate) + run-rate
  CTA; intent/ABM tools (name ONE) or ad pixels (generic, never name pixels) → EMAIL 3
  Memgraph signal-activation story + signal-mapping CTA. `_cached_tech()` returns
  `(line, playbook)`; legacy rows without parseable detail degrade to line-only.
  Persona/batch-runner agents carry matching instructions; HubSpot write-back PATCHes the
  `technographic_signals` company property (best-effort — company matched by `domain`;
  `TECH_HUBSPOT_WRITEBACK=0` kills it; needs company read/write + schema scopes on the
  token, otherwise it logs and moves on).
- **Gotchas:** every import of `tech_signals`/dnspython must stay lazy (boot rule above).
  A scan only counts as failed when BOTH channels died (fetch error AND zero DNS records) —
  never store a network-dead run as "No signals detected". `--self-test` runs offline
  against vendored fixtures (works without dnspython/network).

## Hiring signals (added 2026-07)

Per-account job-postings scan — is the company hiring, and specifically for sales/GTM
roles? Ported from the `hubspot-hiring-signals` repo as a **stdlib rewrite** (urllib +
hand-rolled retry; NO requests/tenacity/pyyaml — zero new pip deps).

- **Engine:** `.claude/skills/sdr-pipeline/scripts/hiring_signals.py` (module + CLI).
  One Prospeo `enrich-company` call per domain (`PROSPEO_API_KEY`, **one credit per
  non-cached scan**) → `job_postings.active_count/active_titles`; the sales/GTM subset
  comes from the regex taxonomy ported verbatim from that repo's `config.yaml`
  (exclude beats include).
- **Storage** (`account_signals.hiring_*`, semantics mirror tech): `hiring_signals` =
  formatted line (`"14 open roles · 4 sales: SDR; AE; VP Sales"`) or the literal
  `"No open roles detected"`; NULL + `hiring_error` = the scan itself failed (retries
  next touch). Prospeo's definitive non-matches (NO_MATCH/NO_RESULT/NO_IDENTIFIER/
  INVALID_DATAPOINT) store the literal + `error_code` in `hiring_detail` — a credit
  guard so unmatchable domains aren't re-billed every touch. `hiring_checked_at` drives
  `HIRING_REFRESH_DAYS` (default 90).
- **Rate-limit gotcha (load-bearing):** Prospeo signals throttling as **HTTP 200 +
  `{"error":true,"error_code":"Rate limit exceeded"}`** — `_prospeo_request` retries it
  like a 429 (Retry-After honored, capped 16s; 5 attempts, expo backoff) and must never
  store it as a result. Unknown error codes classify as transport failures (retry).
- **When it runs:** same three hooks as tech — (1) inline in `generate_batch.py` on a
  research cache miss + after a UI signal refresh; (2) Signals view (drawer "⚑ Detect
  hiring", bulk "Detect hiring": `POST /api/signals/hiring/detect`,
  `POST /api/signals/hiring/backfill` + `GET /api/signals/hiring/status/<id>`, separate
  `HIRING_JOBS` registry); (3) fire-and-forget tail after Message-Batches (separate
  thread from the tech tail).
- **Copy consumer (the rule both engines carry):** when the sales subset is non-empty,
  `_cached_hiring()` feeds a compact line into the prompt and **email 2 opens on it**
  (count + 1-2 roles, tied to covering pipeline while the new reps ramp); email 1 keeps
  the researched news signal; skip if email 1 already covers hiring; never name the data
  source or claim postings are new. When a tech sequencing play is also present, hiring
  still opens email 2 and the sequencing point shrinks to one supporting line. Matching
  wording lives in: `generate_batch.py` (`build_user` + earn/show WRITE_RULES),
  `icp-email.md` 4-touch table, `cta-offers.md` cadence + Tier lists, `offer.md` (Memgraph
  signal-activation story + 2-5x infra claim), the gold example
  (`examples/icp-email-sequence.md`), `sdr-batch-runner.md`, and the 4 persona agents —
  `grep -rn "email 2\|EMAIL 2\|email 3\|EMAIL 3\|signal-mapping\|run[- ]rate"` over those
  files is the drift checklist. Counts with NO sales roles are not a hook.
- **HubSpot write-back:** refreshes the SAME three company properties the
  hubspot-hiring-signals job maintains — `open_roles_count` (str int),
  `hiring_signals_job_titles` (`<br>`-joined HTML, ALL titles), `hiring_signals`
  (`"; "`-joined **sales subset** — NOT the display line). Matched-with-0-postings
  clears stale values; non-matches skip. Best-effort by domain;
  `HIRING_HUBSPOT_WRITEBACK=0` kills it.
- **Gotchas:** keep every `import hiring_signals` lazy (boot rule); the server must boot
  with `PROSPEO_API_KEY` unset (endpoints return `hiring_available:false`, detect → 501).
  Run a first bulk backfill with `--limit` — every non-skipped scan is a credit.
  `--self-test` is offline (no key/network/DB).

## Signal notes contact write-back (added 2026-08)

After every batch ingest, the researched signal + **email touch 1's body only**
(user-approved scope/format: `Signal:\n<signal>\n\n<body1>` — no subject, no body label,
never touches 2-4 or LinkedIn) is mirrored to the HubSpot **contact** property
`sdr_signal_notes` (multi-line text, pre-existing in the portal).

- **Helper:** `.claude/skills/sdr-pipeline/scripts/signal_notes.py` (stdlib-only) —
  `format_note()` / `note_update()` / `sync_contacts()`. Best-effort in the tech/hiring
  write-back style: lazy client singleton, whole-body try/except, stderr logging, never
  raises. `SDR_NOTES_HUBSPOT_WRITEBACK=0` kills it (caller-evaluated via `enabled()`).
- **Hook:** `sdr_batches.py cmd_ingest` — the single choke point all three generation
  paths funnel through (inline UI job, Message-Batches poller, CLI). Contacts that
  ingest as `generated` are collected and PATCHed in ONE `batch_update("contacts", ...)`
  call (contact_id IS the HubSpot id — no lookup). Latest generation wins (re-ingest
  re-syncs); an asset with no touch 1 yields no update, so notes are never blanked.
- **stdout contract (load-bearing):** `cmd_ingest` prints exactly ONE stdout line and
  `app.py` head-truncates it to 200 chars — the sync outcome is appended to that line
  (`, notes: N synced`); all detail goes to stderr. Never add stdout lines before it.
- **Backfill:** `sdr_batches.py notes-backfill [--dry-run] [--limit N]
  [--status generated,enrolled,skipped]` — one-time catch-up over pipeline.db contacts
  joined to `generated/<cid>.json`; idempotent, no ledger. `--dry-run` prints a sample
  note to stderr.
- **Gotchas:** one deleted/merged contact id 4xx-fails a whole 100-chunk — `sync_contacts`
  retries that chunk one-by-one to isolate it (matters for the ~2k backfill, not fresh
  25-contact ingests). `ensure_contact_property` may 403 without schema scopes — it's
  wrapped separately and skipped (the property already exists). Notes truncate at 65,000
  chars (HubSpot multi-line cap is 65,536).

## Unenrollment checker (added 2026-07)

Suppression sweeps: contacts RevOps tagged with the HubSpot contact property
`everworker_tag = "false"` (enumeration, values `"true"`/`"false"`) must never be touched
by the AI SDR again — they booked a meeting, became an opportunity, etc.

- **Engine:** `.claude/skills/sdr-pipeline/scripts/unenrollment_check.py` (module + CLI:
  `--json --dry-run --limit --force --contact-id`; `--contact-id` implies `--force`).
  Per sweep: search contacts where
  `everworker_tag EQ "false"` (10k re-window via `hs_object_id GT`), then per contact —
  **Bison**: email → lead (`bison_lead_map`, live fallback) → `lead_scheduled_emails` →
  `stop_future_emails` in each campaign with steps still queued (`scheduled`/`sending
  paused`); **HeyReach**: linkedin url → `get_campaigns_for_lead` → `stop_lead_in_campaign`
  per non-finished campaign. One HubSpot timeline note per actually-stopped contact
  (`UNENROLL_HUBSPOT_NOTE=0` kills it; never for never-enrolled contacts).
- **Ledger:** `unenrollment_log` in pipeline.db, dedup key `<rule>:<channel>:<contact_id>`
  — sweeps are idempotent; `failed` retries every sweep; `skipped_unconfigured` re-arms
  automatically once the channel's API key lands; `done` rows re-verify after
  `UNENROLL_RECHECK_HOURS` (default 24) so a contact re-enrolled while still flagged is
  re-stopped within a day; `--force` re-checks everything now.
  **One-way**: flipping the tag back to `"true"` only re-permits future enrollment (the
  gate's live check wins over the ledger) — stopped sequences stay stopped.
- **Gates:** `hubspot_pull.py` drops flagged contacts at pull time (`skipped.suppressed`);
  `sdr_batches.py cmd_enroll` + `enroll.py main()` call
  `unenrollment_check.suppressed_set()` (live tag check, ledger fallback, fail-open —
  the sweeper is the backstop) and skip suppressed contacts with a `suppressed` count.
- **Server:** `_unenrollment_loop()` every `UNENROLL_CHECK_MINUTES` (default 30,
  `UNENROLL_CHECK_ENABLED=0` disables); `GET /api/unenroll/status` (rules[]-shaped —
  future suppression rules append entries), `POST /api/unenroll/run` (`{dry_run?}`,
  409 if running). UI: Orchestration view — a dashed "safety gate" bar in the diagram +
  an "Unenrollment & suppression rules" card section (Run now / Dry run buttons).
- **Scale + queueing (2026-08 fix, load-bearing):** a RevOps bulk workflow flagged
  ~23k contacts, and the original ascending-id sweep starved never-checked contacts
  behind thousands of retrying failures — newly flagged, still-mid-sequence contacts
  were literally never reached before the 1h `run_script_streaming` timeout killed
  the run. The sweep now queues NEVER-CHECKED contacts first, newest id first
  (capped `UNENROLL_FRESH_LIMIT`, default 1000), then rotates failed/re-check
  retries oldest-ledger-entry first (capped `UNENROLL_RETRY_LIMIT`, default 500).
  Channel API calls are paced (`UNENROLL_PACE_S`, default 0.25s — HeyReach caps at
  300 req/min) and a channel failing `UNENROLL_CIRCUIT_THRESHOLD` (default 8) times
  consecutively is deferred for the rest of the sweep WITHOUT ledger rows (so those
  contacts keep full priority next sweep instead of minting failed rows). Ledger
  writes retry lock contention and never abort the sweep (`ledger_errors` in the
  summary). `unenrollment_counts` exposes `top_errors`; the UI card shows the top
  failure + "Flagged in HubSpot" (last sweep's search total) vs "Contacts swept"
  (ledger coverage) — they legitimately differ while a backlog drains.
- **Gotchas:** HeyReach lead/campaign endpoints all live under the `/campaign/`
  controller (`/campaign/GetCampaignsForLead`, NOT `/lead/…` — the first live run
  404'd on that; paths are cross-checked against the bcharleson/heyreach-cli client).
  Keep `import unenrollment_check` cheap (its module imports are stdlib + batch_db
  only; clients import lazily inside functions — boot rule). NEVER hold a pipeline.db
  write transaction across network calls in ANY writer (the activity sync's lead-map
  refresh once did — its interleaved Bison pagination held the write lock past
  busy_timeout and crashed concurrent sweeps with "database is locked"; it now
  buffers the fetch and writes in one short transaction).

## SLAs — automatic enrollment rules (ported from the Radicle console, 2026-09)

- **Store:** `webui/server/sla_store.py` → `data/outreach/slas.json` (gitignored; `SLA_STORE_PATH`
  override for tests). Validation: name < 100 chars; schedule `every ∈ {5,15} minutes | {1,5,10}
  hours | {3,7,14} days` (days fire at 22:00 UTC — `next_run_after`); ≤ 10 company + ≤ 10
  contact filters (`{property, operator, value | values | high_value, label, type}` with HubSpot
  search operators; IN/NOT_IN → `values`, BETWEEN → value+high_value, HAS_PROPERTY/
  NOT_HAS_PROPERTY valueless); at least one criterion (form or any filter). Per SLA:
  `hubspot_list_id`, `added_ids`, `last_run`, `runs[≤20]`, `totals`, `next_run_at`.
- **Run:** `scripts/sla_run.py --sla-file … --sla-id … [--dry-run] --json` — evaluate
  (company filters → ids → contacts via `associations.company IN` chunks of 100, AND contact
  filters, windowed past the 10k search cap by `hs_object_id GT`; form → `form-integrations/v1/
  submissions/forms/{id}` since `last_run_at` → emails → `find_existing_email_ids` → filtered
  by the criteria) → minus pipeline-DB contacts (via `batch_db.connect()`) and `added_ids` →
  `create_list("AI SDR SLA · <name>")` (idempotent by name) + `add_contacts_to_list` → JSON
  summary as the last stdout line. Dry-run never writes. `app.run_sla` (single-flight per SLA,
  `SLA_RUNS`) then runs `do_ingest(list_id, source="sla:<id>")` under `INGEST_LOCK` (manual
  `/api/ingest` takes the same lock → 409 if busy) and `record_run` rolls totals + next_run.
  `_sla_loop` checks `due()` every 60 s (`SLA_ENABLED` gate, read via `read_env()` like the
  other loops). HubSpot metadata for the wizard: `hubspot_forms_payload` (`/marketing/v3/forms`,
  10-min cache) and `hubspot_properties_payload` (`/crm/v3/properties/{contacts|companies}`,
  options for enumerations, exact/prefix-ranked search).
- **Pull history:** `data/outreach/pull_history.json` (gitignored; `record_pull` in `do_ingest`
  parses the pull's "Pulled N list members → M read → K ICP contacts." stdout line) →
  `pulled_at/pulled_kept/pulled_source/pulls` merged into `/api/hubspot/lists` rows;
  `ListPicker` shows the badge/column/"Pull again". `search_lists` in `hubspot_client.py` now
  pages through every match and orders newest-created first (the API has no sort).
- **UI (Use view, reworked to match):** "Select Target Audience" header; one **CRM List** panel —
  type dropdown + search + collapsed show/hide-lists table (Created/Size/Pulled/ID columns),
  Select → inline "2 · Selected … Confirm — run pull + init" banner; `SlaPanel.jsx`
  (table + `SlaWizard`: schedule → criteria (FormPicker, FilterGroup ×2 with PropertyPicker +
  FilterRow operators/values by type; enum options are UI-only and re-fetched on edit) →
  confirm) mounted below it. Stats + pending batches live on the Pipeline tab.

## Background jobs (daemon threads started in `app.py main()`)

1. `_activity_autosync_loop` — hourly: logs new email/LinkedIn activity to HubSpot.
2. `_aisdr_sync_loop` — nightly midnight ET: deal attribution (above).
3. HeyReach webhook drain — near-real-time LinkedIn activity logging.
4. `_unenrollment_loop` — every 30 min: everworker_tag suppression sweeps (above).
5. `_sla_loop` — every 60 s: runs due SLAs (`SLA_ENABLED` gate; section above).

## HubSpot notes

- The app's own token (`HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN`, private app, EU portal 144358290 — but API
  host is always `api.hubapi.com`) is the source of truth for API capability.
- The HubSpot **MCP** connector available in Claude sessions has narrower scopes: it can
  read/search deals & contacts but CANNOT read email engagements or run SQL
  (`reporting-base-read` missing). Use it for spot-checks; use the app's scripts for real
  work.
- Custom properties in the portal: deals `ai_sdr_deal_created` (bool); contacts
  `ai_sdr_deal_created`, `ai_sdr_meeting_booked`, `ai_sdr_reply_generated` (+
  `ai_sdr_status`, `ai_sdr_errors`), and `everworker_tag` (RevOps-maintained
  enumeration `"true"`/`"false"`; `"false"` = do-not-contact, drives the
  unenrollment checker). Contact LinkedIn URL property =
  `HUBSPOT_LINKEDIN_PROPERTY` (default `hs_linkedin_url`). Owner/created-by id→name maps
  come free from the `hubspot_owner_id` / `hs_created_by_user_id` property definitions'
  enum options — no extra scope needed.

## Dev / verification quickies

```bash
python3 -m py_compile webui/server/app.py .claude/skills/sdr-pipeline/scripts/*.py
env -u PORT python3 webui/server/app.py --port 8787   # boots WITHOUT pymongo/MONGO_URL/dnspython
cd webui/frontend && npm ci && npm run build           # SPA build (Dockerfile stage 1)
python3 .claude/skills/sdr-pipeline/scripts/tech_signals.py --self-test   # offline detector check
python3 .claude/skills/sdr-pipeline/scripts/hiring_signals.py --self-test # offline hiring-classifier check
```
The server must always boot with `MONGO_URL` unset (aisdr endpoints return
`{"configured": false}`, nightly loop self-disables) — preserve that when touching
anything Mongo-related.
