# Value-Anchored CTA / Offer Library

The core of "offers testing." An **offer** here = the **CTA inside the email**. We lead with a
valuable give, but **the give is delivered ON a meeting** — our SDR team does nothing until a
meeting is booked. So every CTA **anchors a meeting ask on the value**: the give is the reason to
take the call, not a freebie sent cold.

**Hard rules:**
- **Every CTA must ask for a meeting** (15 min, quick call, "walk you through"). No "send it over,
  no call" — we don't deliver anything until we're talking.
- **Anchor the meeting on a real, deliverable give** (something we can actually show on the call).
- Do NOT promise a prospect their own "de-anonymized visitors" or "25 in-market accounts" — fake.

## Why value-anchored meeting asks win
GTM leaders ignore "got 15 minutes?" because it gives them nothing. They take a call when there's
something specific and useful waiting on the other side. Lead with the give, make the meeting the
way to get it.

## The library (give + meeting ask)

### Tier A — product-as-the-give
1. **Signal play (hiring + technographic)** — *"I built a personalized **signal play** for {company}
   off your hiring and tech-stack signals — accounts showing them progress ~**4.4x** faster. Worth
   **15 minutes** for me to walk you through it?"*
2. **Pipeline gap analysis** — *"Want to **grab 15 minutes**? I'll walk you through our **pipeline
   model** and show exactly how many meetings {company} needs to hit target this quarter."*
3. **Personalized drafts** — *"I had our AI SDR draft **3 personalized emails to your top 3
   accounts**. Want to **hop on a quick call** and I'll walk you through them?"*
4. **Run-rate + signal-set estimate** — *"**Worth 15 minutes**? I'll calculate {company}'s current
   meeting **run rate**, map the **signal set** you're already generating, and walk you through how
   many **additional meetings** the AI SDR would add on top."* (the step-2 default)
5. **Signal-mapping session** — *"Want to **grab 15 minutes**? We'll map {company}'s **signal
   sets**, find the **highest-yield sources**, and I'll show you exactly where the AI SDR increases
   output."* (the step-3 default, paired with the Memgraph signal-activation proof)

### Tier B — analysis / teardown gives
6. **Outbound teardown** — *"**Worth 15 minutes?** I'll walk you through a **teardown of your current
   outbound** — 3 things I'd change. Our best practices alone usually lift response rates 50–70%."*
7. **Peer benchmark** — *"Want to **grab time** so I can walk you through how {company}'s reply rate
   compares to other {seed/Series-A} startups?"* (replies/LinkedIn only — retired from email step 3)
8. **Pilot playbook** — *"Before I close your file — **worth 15 minutes** to walk through a one-page
   **playbook of 3 AI-SDR plays** for your {team/motion}?"* (the breakup-step meeting ask)

### Anti-patterns — DO NOT USE
- ✗ "Want me to send it over? Yours to keep, no call needed." (we deliver only on a meeting)
- ✗ "Got 15 minutes for a quick call?" (a meeting ask with NO value hook — anchor it on a give)
- ✗ "Want 25 in-market accounts / your de-anonymized visitors?" (undeliverable / fake)

## Cadence placement (4-touch email)
- **Step 1 (opener):** Tier-A give + meeting ask — signal play or pipeline gap.
- **Step 2:** the **run-rate + signal-set estimate** give + meeting ask. (When a hiring signal is
  provided, open email 2 on it: open-role count + 1-2 sales roles, tied to coverage while the new
  reps ramp. When a sequencing play is flagged, add the no-disruption line: the AI SDR ships its
  own email + LinkedIn infrastructure and capacity, so nothing about their tools or process
  changes — 2–5x more meetings on top of the current run rate; with hiring present that shrinks to
  one supporting line.)
- **Step 3:** the Memgraph **signal-activation** proof + the **signal-mapping session** give +
  meeting ask. (Name ONE detected intent/ABM tool when flagged; when only ad pixels are flagged,
  reference their ad investment generically — never name pixels; otherwise tell the Memgraph
  signal-set story on its own: reo.dev, 6sense, product telemetry surfacing more in-market
  accounts than the team could prospect, activated by the AI SDR.)
- **Step 4 (breakup):** *"Before I close your file, worth 15 minutes to walk through the playbook?"*

## Iteration loop
1. Generate a sequence with a chosen primary give (`SKILL.md` → generate).
2. Generate **N CTA variants** for the same lead (`examples/cta-variants.md`).
3. Ship; on the next `analyze_icp_cta.py`, watch which give+meeting framings earn replies and
   promote winners.

## Guardrails for any CTA
- Must **ask for a meeting** AND **anchor it on a deliverable give**.
- One ask per email. Keep the meeting ask low-friction (15 min, a quick call).
