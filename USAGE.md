# USAGE — SDR Pipeline & Analysis Commands

Quick reference for running everything yourself from the terminal. All commands assume you are in the
project root:

```bash
cd "/Users/ameyadeshmukh/Documents/sdraiworker/reply management"
```

Everything is pure Python standard library — **no installs needed**. Secrets/config live in `.env`.

## 0. One-time config (`.env`)

| Variable | What it is | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `EMAILBISON_API_KEY` / `EMAILBISON_BASE_URL` | Bison token + instance (`send.everworker.ai`) | ✅ set |
| `HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN` / `HUBSPOT_BASE_URL` | HubSpot private-app token (`api.hubapi.com`) | ✅ set |
| `HUBSPOT_LIST_ID` | The HubSpot list to pull | ✅ `2198` |
| `HUBSPOT_LINKEDIN_PROPERTY` | Contact property holding the LinkedIn URL | `hs_linkedin_url` |
| `BISON_CAMPAIGN_SALES_LEADERSHIP/_REVOPS/_PARTNERSHIPS/_SDR_BDR` | Per-persona email campaigns | ✅ `10 / 11 / 12 / 13` |

## 1. THE MAIN FLOW — batch outbound (recommended)

This batches your HubSpot contacts (25/batch), generates copy with parallel sub-agents, and enrolls
into Bison. State lives in SQLite (`data/outreach/pipeline.db`), so it's resumable.

### Easiest: the slash command (inside Claude Code)
```
/sdr-batches 2            # process 2 batches (50 contacts), DRY-RUN enroll (no writes)
/sdr-batches 2 enroll     # process 2 batches and LIVE-enroll into Bison
/sdr-batches all enroll   # process every pending batch and live-enroll
```
The slash command runs init, dispatches the `sdr-batch-runner` agents in parallel, then enrolls.

### Manual, step by step (terminal)
```bash
P=.claude/skills/sdr-pipeline/scripts

# (a) Refresh contacts from HubSpot list 2198  ->  data/outreach/contacts.jsonl
python3 $P/hubspot_pull.py

# (b) Load contacts into the batch DB (idempotent); makes 25-contact batches
python3 $P/sdr_batches.py init

# (c) See where things stand
python3 $P/sdr_batches.py status
python3 $P/sdr_batches.py pending-batches            # list pending batch ids

# (d) GENERATION happens via Claude sub-agents — use the slash command for this part,
#     or inspect a batch yourself:
python3 $P/sdr_batches.py get-batch 1                 # the 25 contacts in batch 1
#     (a sub-agent writes data/outreach/generated/<contact_id>.json, then:)
python3 $P/sdr_batches.py ingest 1                    # lint files + mark generated/failed
#     (ingest also mirrors signal + email 1 to the HubSpot contact property
#      sdr_signal_notes — best-effort; SDR_NOTES_HUBSPOT_WRITEBACK=0 disables)

# (e) Enroll everything marked "generated" into Bison (per-persona campaigns)
python3 $P/sdr_batches.py enroll --dry-run            # preview payloads, no writes
python3 $P/sdr_batches.py enroll                      # LIVE: create leads + attach to 10/11/12/13

# Fix-ups
python3 $P/sdr_batches.py reset-batch 7               # set batch 7 + its contacts back to pending
python3 $P/sdr_batches.py notes-backfill --dry-run    # preview signal+email-1 notes -> HubSpot contacts
python3 $P/sdr_batches.py notes-backfill              # LIVE one-time backfill of sdr_signal_notes
```

**Contact status:** `pending → generated → enrolled` (or `failed` with the lint reason).
Re-running only picks up unfinished work.

---

## 2. Single-shot / file-based outbound (no DB)

For a one-off or small set without the batch DB.
```bash
P=.claude/skills/sdr-pipeline/scripts

python3 $P/hubspot_pull.py            # pull list -> data/outreach/contacts.jsonl (US/tech ICP only)
# (generate copy per contact via the persona agents -> data/outreach/generated/<id>.json)
python3 $P/enroll.py --dry-run        # preview Bison payloads (per-persona routing)
python3 $P/enroll.py                  # live enroll; idempotent via data/outreach/enroll_state.json
```

**Lint any sequence markdown** (the guardrail check):
```bash
python3 .claude/skills/ai-sdr/scripts/lint_sequence.py .claude/skills/ai-sdr/examples/icp-email-sequence.md
```
Checks: 70–110 words, paragraph breaks, no sign-off, no em dashes, value-anchored **meeting** CTA,
step-4 breakup, a metric, no pricing, no undeliverable gives.

**Classify a job title** (ICP gate + persona routing):
```bash
echo "VP of Sales" | python3 .claude/skills/ai-sdr/scripts/buyer_group.py
```

---

## 3. Email Bison — pull data

```bash
B=.claude/skills/email-bison/scripts

python3 $B/fetch_interested_replies.py   # all "Interested" replies -> data/interested-replies/
python3 $B/fetch_campaign_stats.py       # campaign + per-step stats -> data/campaign-stats/
```

---

## 4. Analysis (reads the pulled data)

```bash
T=.claude/skills/interested-trends/scripts

python3 $T/analyze_interested.py     # descriptive features -> analysis/ (summary.json + CSVs)
python3 $T/analyze_conversion.py     # TRUE conversion rates by campaign/offer/geo/step
python3 $T/analyze_cohorts.py        # cohort (Marketing/Sales/CEO-Founder/Other) + qualitative prep
python3 $T/analyze_icp_cta.py        # ICP buyer-group filter + value-first-vs-time-ask CTA baseline
python3 $T/cohort_deepdive.py Sales  # verbatim evidence book for one cohort (Sales|Marketing|"CEO/Founder"|Other)
```
Outputs land in `data/interested-replies/analysis/` (reports: `trends-report.md`,
`conversion-report.md`, `cohort-playbook.md`, `sales-cohort-deepdive.md`, `icp-cta-report.md`).

## 5. AI SDR deal attribution (nightly HubSpot -> MongoDB sync)

Runs automatically at midnight US Eastern inside the deployed web server (needs
`MONGO_URL` — the Railway MongoDB service). Manual runs, from the console's Analytics
page ("Sync attribution") or the CLI:

```bash
P=.claude/skills/sdr-pipeline/scripts

python3 $P/aisdr_attribution_sync.py --json              # incremental (watermark) sync
python3 $P/aisdr_attribution_sync.py --json --dry-run    # compute, but no HubSpot writes
python3 $P/aisdr_attribution_sync.py --json --full       # re-scan all emails from scratch
```

Pulls every email engagement sent by `HUBSPOT_AISDR_FROM_EMAIL`, joins email -> contact ->
deals, snapshots into MongoDB (db `aisdr`: `emails` / `contacts` / `deals` / `sync_state`),
and sets `ai_sdr_deal_created=true` on deals created after the contact's first AI SDR email
(and on those contacts). Requires the `sales-email-read` scope on the HubSpot token.
Results feed the "Deals created by AI SDR" / "Total pipeline" tiles on the Analytics page
(`GET /api/analytics/aisdr`). See `CLAUDE.md` for the full design and gotchas.

## 6. Technographic signals (which tech an account runs)

Deterministic website + DNS scan (no LLM, no API keys — vendored `technographics/`
engine) producing a line like `CRM: HubSpot | Ad Pixels: Meta Pixel | Martech: Segment`.
Runs automatically with account research and after batch generation; results live on the
Signals view (Tech column, per-row **⌁ Detect**, bulk **Detect missing**) and are written
to the HubSpot company property `technographic_signals` (disable: `TECH_HUBSPOT_WRITEBACK=0`).
Copy generation also acts on the detections via playbook groups: sequencing tools
(Outreach/Salesloft/Apollo) steer **email 2** (no-disruption angle + run-rate CTA), and
intent/ABM tools or ad pixels steer **email 3** (Memgraph signal-activation story +
signal-mapping CTA); chat/scheduling tools are never mentioned in copy. Manual runs:

```bash
P=.claude/skills/sdr-pipeline/scripts

python3 $P/tech_signals.py --domain acme.com             # scan one company (cached 90d; --force to re-scan)
python3 $P/tech_signals.py --missing --limit 50          # backfill accounts with no scan yet
python3 $P/tech_signals.py --self-test                   # offline fixture check (no network needed)
```

Add `--no-hubspot` to skip the property write-back; `--rendered` uses headless Chromium
for JS-heavy sites (Claude sessions only — the Railway image has no browser).

---

## 7. Hiring signals (is the account hiring sales/GTM roles?)

Prospeo job-postings lookup (needs `PROSPEO_API_KEY`; ONE credit per non-cached scan)
producing a line like `14 open roles · 4 sales: SDR; AE; VP Sales`. Runs automatically
with account research and after batch generation; results live on the Signals view
(Hiring column, drawer **⚑ Detect hiring**, bulk **Detect hiring**) and refresh the
HubSpot company properties `open_roles_count` / `hiring_signals_job_titles` /
`hiring_signals` (disable: `HIRING_HUBSPOT_WRITEBACK=0`). When open sales/GTM roles are
found, generation opens **email 2** on the hiring signal (email 1 keeps the researched
news signal; a tech sequencing play then shrinks to one supporting line). Manual runs:

```bash
P=.claude/skills/sdr-pipeline/scripts

python3 $P/hiring_signals.py --domain acme.com           # scan one company (cached 90d; --force to re-scan)
python3 $P/hiring_signals.py --missing --limit 50        # backfill accounts with no scan yet (credits!)
python3 $P/hiring_signals.py --self-test                 # offline check (no network, no key needed)
```

Add `--no-hubspot` to skip the property write-back. A company Prospeo can't match is
stored as "No open roles detected" with the error code in the drawer, and is not
re-scanned (or re-billed) until the refresh window lapses.

## Troubleshooting

- **`pending-batches` is empty but you expected batches** — run `sdr_batches.py init` (loads new
  contacts into batches). Re-run `hubspot_pull.py` first if the list changed.
- **`enroll` says `no_campaign`** — the per-persona `BISON_CAMPAIGN_*` ids aren't set in `.env`.
- **A batch had failures** — `status` shows `failed` counts; the per-contact `error` (lint reason) is
  in the DB. Re-generate those, then `ingest <id>` again, or `reset-batch <id>` to redo the whole batch.
- **New `/sdr-batches` command or `sdr-batch-runner` agent not found** — reload the Claude Code session.
- **Blank line before the email signature** — set this in Bison (prepend a blank line to the sender
  signature); Bison strips trailing whitespace from the lead body, so it can't come from the copy.
- **Bison/HubSpot/HeyReach 401** — token/instance mismatch; check the matching `*_API_KEY` and
  `*_BASE_URL` in `.env`.
- **Always dry-run before a live enroll** (`enroll --dry-run`) to eyeball routing + payloads.
```

## Replies management (webui → Replies)

The Replies view is a two-pane inbox over both reply channels (Bison email + HeyReach
LinkedIn). Left: the message list — **Interested** (draft & send), **Possible interested**
(review), **Other** (not interested / low confidence), **Done & dismissed**. Right: the full
conversation thread (outbound sequence, the reply, and any console-sent follow-ups, merged
chronologically) plus the actions for that reply.

- **Dismiss** ("handled in CRM") clears a lead from the queue without sending anything —
  for leads you've already replied to / booked from HubSpot. Dismissals persist across
  rescans (`data/interested-replies/reply_state.json`, keyed per lead) and auto-expire the
  moment the lead sends a **new** reply.
- **Reclassify as interested** promotes a misclassified "Other" reply: it's enriched on
  demand, flipped to interested (the model's original verdict is kept for audit), tagged in
  Bison, and moved to the Interested queue. The override survives rescans.
- **Reply agents** — each interested reply has an agent dropdown + Regenerate:
  - **Standard**: the playbook-grounded drafter (`draft_followups.py`).
  - **Signal Playbook**: builds a personalized signal play for the lead's company
    (research → deck-data → single-file HTML via `deck-renderer/`), publishes it as a
    LIVE HubSpot website page at `everworker.ai/signal-plays/<company>-ai-sdr-playbook`
    (`content` scope required; instant publish via draft → push-live, same URL on
    rebuilds), and drafts a reply embedding the page link. Runs as a background job with
    stage progress; artifacts land in `data/signal-plays/<slug>/`. Falls back to a
    standard draft if the build fails.
- **HubSpot logging is automatic** — an hourly background loop logs replies in/out (and the
  outbound sequence every 12th cycle). There is no manual button. The toolbar shows
  `Last scanned` plus a red dot if the last auto-log failed.

### HubSpot duplicate-logging runbook

If contacts show the same email logged multiple times:

1. **Audit (read-only):** `python3 .claude/skills/sdr-pipeline/scripts/hubspot_activity_audit.py --sample 5`
   (or `--contact-id <id>`; also `GET /api/hubspot/activity/audit`). Each duplicate cluster
   is labeled:
   - `overlapping_loggers` — our sync AND another logger (HubSpot native inbox/BCC logging,
     or HeyReach's native sync + our webhook drain for LinkedIn) both log the same email.
     Fix: turn one off (e.g. disconnect native logging for the SDR aliases, or set
     `HEYREACH_ACTIVITY_AUTOSYNC=0`).
   - `ledger_loss_or_manual` — engagements re-created after the dedup ledger was wiped
     (non-durable volume) or logged by a human.
   - `dedup_bug` — duplicates that are all ours; report it.
2. **Guard:** with an empty ledger, a live sync that would create more than
   `HUBSPOT_ACTIVITY_FRESH_MAX` (default 50) engagements refuses and reports instead.
3. **Recover a wiped ledger:** `python3 .claude/skills/sdr-pipeline/scripts/hubspot_activity_sync.py --reconcile-from-hubspot`
   — adopts existing engagements (matched by contact + timestamp) into the ledger instead of
   re-creating them.

### Data durability (Railway)

Everything the console records lives under `/app/data` — attach a **Railway Volume** mounted
at `/app/data` (service → Settings → Volumes) or it resets on every redeploy. The app checks
this at boot (`/api/system/status`, entrypoint boot marker) and shows a warning banner when
the data dir looks non-durable.
